# NetworkManagerMvvmAsyncAwait

Why Async/Await Improves This

✅ Cleaner flow: No nested closures or completion blocks </br>
✅ Error handling: Native try/throw instead of Result chains </br>
✅ SOLID still respected: NetworkService remains abstract, testable, and mockable </br>
✅ UI responsiveness: Task and @MainActor keep UI thread safe </br>
